# MCP/A2A Adaptation Notes (Quick Start)

This Tier 1 repo includes optional starter schemas for teams planning external orchestration.

- MCP required for tool-facing integrations.
- A2A progressive for cross-runtime interoperability.

Additional schemas:

- `shared/schemas/hook-contract.schema.json`
- `shared/schemas/gate-decision.schema.json`
- `shared/schemas/run-ledger-entry.schema.json`

Use these when graduating from Tier 1 toward Tier 2 orchestration patterns.
